# C155 – Java Programming Foundations

This repository documents the foundational concepts from an introductory Java programming course, structured in a concept-first format.

I have been programming for over 10 years in a self-taught capacity. This course represents a formal reinforcement of core fundamentals — particularly algorithmic thinking, structured logic, and disciplined decomposition.

This repository focuses on understanding, clarity, and real-world mapping — not assignment reproduction.

## Course Focus Areas

The course emphasizes:

- Java syntax and language rules
- Variables and data types
- Operators and expressions
- Conditional logic (if / if-else)
- Loops (iteration and repetition)
- Functions (value vs reference parameters)
- Arrays
- Basic problem-solving process and algorithm design
- Input and output handling

---

## Repository Structure

All documentation is organized by concept:

- /topics
- control-flow.md
- variables-and-types.md


Each topic page includes:

- Concept definition
- Mental model
- Common mistakes
- Real-world application
- Personal refinement notes

---

## Documentation Philosophy

This repository is:

- Concept-driven, not assignment-driven
- Written in plain technical language
- Focused on clarity over cleverness
- Designed to show structured understanding

Graded solutions and course materials are not published here in order to maintain academic integrity and professional standards.

## Why This Matters

Strong fundamentals determine long-term engineering effectiveness.

Clear reasoning about:
- State
- Flow of control
- Data representation
- Decomposition

…reduces defects, improves maintainability, and strengthens system design over time.
